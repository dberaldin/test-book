# Chapter 11

## Foreword

There is no mandatory reason for a book to start from Chapter 1, isn't there? E.g. for a computer scientist it would feel a lot more natural if the first chapter was named `0`. After all it is just a simple label, nothing more than a convention, so why should anyone take too much care of it?  Well, in the case of this book, let me start with Chapter 11.

## Rationale

You may be wondering why the author had decised to start writing all this bullshit and why they chose such a horrible means as a text editor and a bunch of markdown files under version control. It's a long story, so please sit comfortably on your armchair, or wherever you are and keep reading to find out.
